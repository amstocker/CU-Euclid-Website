# Projects


## Gesture Learning (in progress)

I am currently working on a project for learning gestures for music performance.  The goal is primarily to practice machine learning, and also get some hardware experience.  Below is a mockup of the interface which I'll be using.

## Non-linear Sequencer in Rust

The GitHub repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/amstocker/StateMachine).

The idea behind this project is to have an audio sample sequencer with multiple independent tracks, in which each track can also trigger any other track.  I also wanted to get some practice with Rust and with audio programming.  Below is a screenshot of the working prototype.

## Generative music

[Click here](./projects/generative/) for a generative music demo I created ([code can be found here](https://github.com/amstocker/generative)).

## Research Visualizations

[This is a visualization of the full 2-shift](./projects/shift/).  The full 2-shift is a dynamical system defined by shfiting binary sequences.  The visualization is obtained by letting the horizontal coordinate of a sequence correspond to its right tail, and the vertical coordinate correspond to its left tail.

## Collections Library in C

To practice my C programming, I made a small self-contained library of some basic collections which can be found [here](https://github.com/amstocker/collections).

## Personal Website

The idea behind my personal website is that all the content is rendered in markdown and dynamically loaded.  I'm using the [GitHub markdown stylesheet](https://github.com/sindresorhus/github-markdown-css).  If you are a mathematics graduate student at CU Boulder, you can use my [template](https://github.com/amstocker/CU-Euclid-Website) to build a similar website -- feel free to email me with any questions!


## Other Programming

The animation for the background in this page was done using HTML Canvas, you can check out the source [here](https://github.com/amstocker/CU-Euclid-Website/blob/master/src/background.js).

See [my github](https://github.com/amstocker) for other programming projects from over the years.

## Music

I have produced a couple albums which can be found [here on Bandcamp](https://megamaster.bandcamp.com/) and other songs which can be found [here on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/megamaster).
