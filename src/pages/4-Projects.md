The animation for the background in this page was done using HTML Canvas, you can check out the source [here](https://github.com/amstocker/CU-Euclid-Website/blob/master/src/background.js).

## Research Visualizations

[This is a visualization of the full 2-shift](./projects/shift/).  The full 2-shift is a dynamical system obtained by shfiting binary sequences.  The visualization is obtained by letting the horizontal coordinate of a sequence correspond to its right tail, and the unstable direction correspond to its left tail.
