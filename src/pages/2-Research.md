# Research

My research is on a branch mathematical systems theory called _dynamical systems_, and in particular I'm studying the representations of dynamical systems as operator algebras.  In particular I am interested in hyperbolic topological dynamical systems and C*-algebras that can be constructed which capture the asymptotic behavior of these systems.

Here is a talk I gave on these topics at Groupoidfest 2021:
